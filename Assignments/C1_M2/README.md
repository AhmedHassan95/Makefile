### <ins>Requirements</ins>:  

In this programming assignment you will create a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make:

- This assignment will require you to compile multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable. 
- Some files will be provided for you, but you will need to support two platforms; the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432. 
- The host system will allow you to simulate software on a host platform. 
- The target system will be used in upcoming assignments as we begin to create our microcontroller applications.
