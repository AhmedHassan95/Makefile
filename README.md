## Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments

## MOOC Details

The first module of embedded systems MOOC from the University of Colorado Boulder through [**coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/).

Date: December, 2021

This class is 9 Hours : 
- You can find the course of [Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems).

- You can find the **[syllabus](Syllabus.md)** of this course.
 
- The [**Certificate**](https://github.com/AhmedHassan95/Makefile/blob/master/Certificate.pdf) is available.

## Descriptions

Every lab is given as an existant project with a grading system TExaS that remotely permits to evaluate my work (and push the grade on edX MOOC). \
As a consequence, for each lab assignment, I completed an existant project given by the teaching staff with the requirements.

My contributions include:
- Global declarations (essentially for ports) and/or declarations in header files. 
- Functions defintion if already declared by instructors.
- Functions implementation otherwise.

In most of the cases, there are all these alternatives (except with the two first introduction labs).
